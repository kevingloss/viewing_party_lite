        a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New
        Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien''s
        seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings,
        the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien''s
        tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film,
        with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and
        Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon''s critically-acclaimed, audience-adored
        multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous
        for a go-round with Tolkien''s earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien''s
        The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared
        for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically
        quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted
        to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson
        had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning
        masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy
        master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay
        after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative
        team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with
        the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned
        as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro
        retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard
        Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe
        lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit,
        taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film''s framing sequence
        (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship
        of the Ring), along with that trilogy''s star, Elijah Wood. But this time
        out, it''s Freeman''s show, and he''s as charming, witty, and engaging as
        you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is
        truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more
        impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version)
        and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense
        power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf
        as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the
        third of this film''s main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard
        Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves.
        Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is
        easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening
        battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them
        manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the
        two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to
        shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit
        affair: the fact that it''s a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is
        a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of
        the Rings'' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of
        a whopping three hours. And as anyone who''s seen The Return of the King can
        attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film).
        Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into
        three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for
        this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI''ve
        seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent.
        I''m an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down
        to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain:
        I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film.
        It''s astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the
        scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn''t mind it in the least. I believe
        it''s because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The
        Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy''s \"save
        the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around
        Frodo''s neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn''t have
        the weight of the world on its shoulders. It''s rather the difference between
        having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend
        to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely
        have a dire impact on the film''s rewatchability, but sitting in the theater
        for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems
        to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action
        Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the
        film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can''t stress
        enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn''t mind in the least (with one
        exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell
        will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages
        to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his
        most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive
        and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography
        combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights
        (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon''s newfound
        over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and
        the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have
        (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they''re
        fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most
        famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis'' performance and the CGI truly
        sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI
        don''t know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What
        I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and
        if this is any indication of things to come, I''ll most assuredly enjoy the
        ride.","created_at":"2013-07-21T18:24:25.950Z","id":"51ec275919c29551df108d8d","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:21.934Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/51ec275919c29551df108d8d"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Of
        course off the level of its <em>''The Lord of the Rings''</em> predecessors,

        has good lure to it, the plot is more than interesting, it features pleasant
        callbacks and - like LOTR - looks exquisite. As for the casting, I like ''em.
        Martin Freeman (Bilbo) is, like Elijah Wood, an actor I''ve always found hit-and-miss,

        returns and is as much a joy to watch as before. None of the others, though
        all good, stand out massively, James Nesbitt (Bofur) does bring decent comedic
